Simple C# Soundboard for Windows

Hey peeps... I have hacked together a simple Windows app for creating and playing soundboards.  Can y'all help test it out?  Press the keyboard keys to play the sounds.  Click the keys to change the sound files and labels.  Below each key are two labels -- the upper one is when pressing that key with Shift, and lower label is without Shift pressed.  It's open source, but the code is not pretty.  I plan to add a lot of features, this was just a 1-day effort.  The executable is in the Github, or you can compile it yourself with Visual Studio.  You can also save to XML and share the settings file to someone (put all referenced MP3s in same folder).  Let me know if it works for you!
